Gravity force of Earth orbit and an object with rotation.

By applying the Newton's laws of motion.

Second law: The acceleration a of a body is parallel and directly proportional to the net force ( F ) acting on the body, is in the direction of the net force, and is inversely proportional to the mass m of the body.
